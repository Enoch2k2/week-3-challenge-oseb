# Week 3 Challenge

In this challenge we will be associating blogs to authors.

## Instructions
- Run `bundle install` in the terminal
- Read the comments in `blogger_cli.rb` for each method defined.
- To run the code, in terminal type `ruby blogger_cli.rb`.

## Testing code
The `pry` gem will be installed via the gemfile when you run `bundle install`. Make use of `binding.pry` in your code to test your work.

## The Goal
At the bottom of `blogger_cli.rb` is some commented out code.
```
# author.print_blogs # should print out all of the blogs of the author
# hamlet.print_author_blogs # should print out the blogs.author's blogs
# hamlet.print_blog_info # should print the information about one blog
# hamlet.print_author_info # should print out who the author is
```

Make sure that each of the commented out lines does exactly what is described.
